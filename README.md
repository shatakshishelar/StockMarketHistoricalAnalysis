### Project Description: Stock Performance Visualization of Fortune 25 Companies  

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the stock performance of the top 25 companies by market capitalization from 1980 to the present. Using data sourced from MacroTrends, the analysis explores historical trends and the impact of major financial events, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, on stock prices.  

Key objectives include:  
1. **Understanding Cumulative Returns**: Compare the long-term growth of stocks across sectors, regions, and market caps.  
2. **Historical Event Analysis**: Evaluate how significant financial events influenced stock behavior.  
3. **Sectoral and Geographical Trends**: Identify performance patterns based on industry and company headquarters.  

The project employs interactive dashboards developed with Plotly to present the findings. Visualizations include cumulative return graphs, yearly price changes, and event-specific analyses, offering users a dynamic way to explore data filtered by sector, region, timeframe, or market capitalization.  

Through these insights, the project aims to support investor decision-making, academic research, and financial analysis, offering a comprehensive view of market trends and the resilience of top-performing companies.
